## 0. Background Information (Self-Contained Context)

This section provides complete context for understanding this plan. Another LLM or human reader should be able to fully evaluate and improve this plan using only the information contained herein.

### 0.1 The AI Coding Agent Landscape (2025-2026)

AI coding agents are LLM-powered tools that autonomously write, modify, and debug code. Unlike simple code completion (GitHub Copilot circa 2022), modern agents can:

- Execute shell commands and observe output
- Read and write files across entire codebases
- Make multi-file changes to implement features
- Run tests, interpret failures, and fix issues
- Use external tools via function calling / tool use

**Major AI Coding Agents (as of early 2026):**

| Agent | Provider | Interface | Key Characteristics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic | CLI (terminal) | Anthropic's official agentic CLI for Claude. Uses tool-use API. |
| **Codex CLI** | OpenAI | CLI | OpenAI's terminal agent, similar architecture to Claude Code |
| **Gemini CLI** | Google | CLI | Google's agent, supports Gemini models |
| **Cursor** | Cursor Inc | IDE | VS Code fork with deeply integrated AI |
| **Aider** | Open Source | CLI | Python-based, supports multiple models |
| **Continue** | Open Source | IDE Plugin | VS Code/JetBrains plugin |

These agents share a common interaction pattern:
1. User provides a natural language request
2. Agent reasons about the task
3. Agent uses tools (file read/write, bash, search) to accomplish the task
4. Agent presents results and awaits next instruction

**Session transcripts** are the complete logs of these interactions—every user message, agent response, tool call, and tool result. A single coding session might be 10,000-100,000+ tokens.

### 0.2 What Are Claude Code Skills?

**Skills** are Claude Code's mechanism for extending agent capabilities with domain-specific knowledge. A skill is a markdown file (conventionally `SKILL.md`) that gets injected into the agent's context when relevant. In ms, `SKILL.md` is a compiled view; the source-of-truth is `SkillSpec`.

**Why skills exist:** LLMs have general knowledge but lack specific knowledge about:
- Your company's coding conventions
- Your project's architecture decisions
- Specialized workflows (deployment, review processes)
- Tool-specific expertise (your CLI tools, your APIs)
- Lessons learned from past debugging sessions

**Skill file structure:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 11 lines.]

**Session Segmentation (Phase-Aware Mining):**
- Segment sessions into phases: recon → hypothesis → change → validation → regression fix → wrap-up.
- Use tool-call boundaries + language markers to avoid phase bleed.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 9 lines. enums: SessionPhase.]

**Pattern IR (Typed Intermediate Representation):**
- Compile extracted patterns into typed IR before synthesis (e.g., `CommandRecipe`,
  `DiagnosticDecisionTree`, `Invariant`, `Pitfall`, `PromptMacro`, `RefactorPlaybook`,
  `ChecklistItem`).
- Normalize commands, filepaths, tool names, and error signatures for deterministic dedupe.

**SKILL.md anatomy:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=markdown, 62 lines.]

**Conditional blocks:** The `::: block` syntax allows version-specific content. At load time, `ms` evaluates predicates against the project environment (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.) and strips blocks whose conditions evaluate false. The agent never sees irrelevant version-specific content.

**How skills are loaded:** Claude Code discovers skills from configured paths (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` in projects). When a user invokes a skill (explicitly or via auto-suggestion), its content is injected into the conversation context.

**The token budget problem:** Each skill consumes context window tokens. A 500-line skill might use 3,000-5,000 tokens. With context windows of 128K-200K tokens and complex codebases already consuming much of that, skill loading must be strategic.

### 0.3 What Is CASS (Coding Agent Session Search)?

**CASS** (Coding Agent Session Search) is a Rust CLI tool that indexes and searches across historical coding agent sessions from multiple tools. It solves the problem: "I know I solved this before, but I can't find where."

**What CASS indexes:**
- Claude Code sessions (`.jsonl` files in `~/.claude/projects/`)
- Codex CLI sessions
- Gemini CLI sessions
- Cursor sessions (exported)
- ChatGPT code-heavy conversations (exported)
- Custom agent transcripts

**Key CASS capabilities:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 16 lines. commands: cass, cass, cass, cass, cass, cass.]

**Robot mode:** All CASS commands support `--robot` for machine-readable JSON output. This is critical for programmatic integration—ms will call CASS as a subprocess and parse its JSON output.

**CASS search technology:**
- **Lexical search:** Tantivy (Rust port of Lucene) for BM25 full-text search
- **Semantic search:** Hash-based embeddings (no ML model required)
- **Hybrid fusion:** Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combines both rankings

**Session structure:** A session is a sequence of messages:
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=json, 4 lines.]

**Why CASS matters for ms:** CASS contains thousands of solved problems. When an agent successfully debugged an auth issue, that solution is in CASS. When a deployment workflow was refined over 10 sessions, the evolution is in CASS. ms can mine this to generate skills automatically.

### 0.4 What Is xf (X Archive Search)?

**xf** is a Rust CLI tool for searching personal X (Twitter) data archives. It's the architectural template for ms because it exemplifies the exact patterns we want:

**xf's technical stack:**
- **Language:** Rust (Edition 2024, ~23,000 LOC)
- **CLI framework:** clap with derive macros
- **Storage:** SQLite with WAL mode, FTS5 virtual tables
- **Search:** Tantivy BM25 + hash-based embeddings + RRF fusion
- **Async runtime:** Tokio
- **Output:** Human-readable by default, `--format json` for automation
- **Auto-update:** Self-updating binary via GitHub Releases

**Why follow xf exactly:**
1. **Proven patterns:** xf is battle-tested on real workloads
2. **Same author:** The ms author created xf, so patterns are familiar
3. **Same constraints:** Both are local-first CLI tools with search + indexing
4. **Code reuse:** Many modules can be adapted directly

**Key xf patterns to adopt:**

| Pattern | xf Implementation | ms Adaptation |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Hybrid search | BM25 + hash embeddings + RRF | Same, for skill search |
| Hash embeddings | FNV-1a hash, 384 dimensions | Same, no ML dependency |
| SQLite storage | WAL mode, PRAGMA tuning | Same, for skill registry |
| Robot mode | `--format json` flag | `--robot` flag |
| Auto-update | GitHub Releases + SHA256 | Same mechanism |
| Indexing | Background thread, progress bar | Same UX |

**Hash embeddings explained:** Instead of using a neural network (BERT, etc.) to generate embeddings, xf uses a deterministic hash function:

1. Tokenize text into words
2. Hash each word with FNV-1a
3. Use hash bits to determine which embedding dimensions to increment/decrement
4. Normalize the resulting vector

This provides ~80-90% of neural embedding quality with zero dependencies, instant speed, and perfect reproducibility.

### 0.5 What Is mcp_agent_mail (Agent Mail)?

**Agent Mail** is a coordination system for multi-agent workflows. It provides:
- **Message passing:** Agents send messages to each other
- **File reservations:** Advisory locks to prevent edit conflicts
- **Project identity:** Agents know they're working on the same project

**The dual persistence pattern:** Agent Mail writes data to both SQLite (for queries) and Git (for auditability):

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 15 lines.]

**Why ms adopts this:** Skills benefit from both:
- **SQLite:** Fast search, usage tracking, quality scores
- **Git:** Version history, collaborative editing, sync across machines

**Two-Phase Commit (2PC):** To prevent drift between SQLite and Git, ms uses a
lightweight two-phase commit for all write operations.

**File reservation pattern:** When an agent wants to edit a file, it requests a reservation:
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 2 lines. commands: agent_mail.]

ms can use similar reservations for skill editing to prevent conflicts.

### 0.6 What Is NTM (Named Tmux Manager)?

**NTM** is a Go CLI that transforms tmux into a multi-agent command center. It spawns and orchestrates multiple AI coding agents in parallel.

**Why NTM matters for ms:**
1. **Multi-agent skill loading:** When NTM spawns agents, each needs appropriate skills
2. **Skill coordination:** Multiple agents shouldn't redundantly load same skills
3. **Context rotation:** As agents exhaust context, skills must transfer to fresh agents

**NTM agent types:**
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 2 lines. commands: ntm, ntm.]

**Integration point:** ms should provide:
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 3 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms.]

### 0.7 What Is BV (Beads Viewer) and the Beads System?

**Beads** is a lightweight issue/task tracking system designed for AI agent workflows. Unlike Jira/Linear, beads are:
- **File-based:** Stored in `.beads/` directory
- **Git-native:** Tracked in version control
- **Agent-friendly:** Simple enough for agents to read/write

**Bead structure:**
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=yaml, 10 lines.]

**BV (Beads Viewer)** is the CLI for interacting with beads:
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 5 lines. commands: bd, bd, bd, bd, bd.]

**Beads Viewer Integration (bv):**
- Prefer `bv --robot-*` flags for deterministic JSON (triage, plan, graph, insights).
- Use `bv --robot-triage` as the single entry point for actionable, dependency-aware picks.
- Avoid bare `bv` in automation (it launches interactive TUI).

**Why this matters for ms:** Skills can be tracked as beads. A skill-building session could be:
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 3 lines. commands: bd, ms, bd.]

### 0.8 The Agent Flywheel Ecosystem

The **Agent Flywheel** is an integrated suite of tools that compound AI agent effectiveness:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 40 lines.]

**Other flywheel tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **CM** (Cass Memory) | Procedural memory—learns rules from session analysis |
| **DCG** (Destructive Command Guard) | Safety system blocking dangerous commands |
| **ACIP** | Prompt injection defense framework (primary for Section 5.17) |
| **UBS** (Ultimate Bug Scanner) | Static analysis for catching bugs pre-commit |
| **BV** (Beads Viewer) | Graph-aware Beads triage + dependency insights |
| **RU** (Repo Updater) | Syncs GitHub repos, handles updates |
| **XF** (X Archive Search) | Twitter archive search (architectural template) |

### 0.9 Token Efficiency: Why It Matters

**The context window constraint:** LLMs have finite context windows:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: 200K tokens
- GPT-4 Turbo: 128K tokens
- Gemini 1.5 Pro: 2M tokens (but performance degrades at scale)

**A typical coding session consumes:**
- System prompt: 2,000-5,000 tokens
- Project context (AGENTS.md, etc.): 3,000-10,000 tokens
- Codebase reading: 10,000-50,000+ tokens
- Conversation history: Grows throughout session
- **Skills:** Variable, 500-5,000 tokens each

**Token density imperative:** Skills must maximize information per token:

| Bad (Verbose) | Good (Token-Dense) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "When you are working with Git and you need to..." | "Git operations:" |
| "It's important to remember that..." | (Just state the fact) |
| "Here's an example of how you might..." | "Example:" |
| Repeating information across sections | Single source of truth |
| Generic advice applicable anywhere | Specific, actionable guidance |

**Progressive disclosure solves this:** Don't load entire 5,000-token skills when 500 tokens suffice:

| Level | Tokens | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Minimal | ~100 | Name + one-line description |
| Overview | ~500 | + Section headings, key points |
| Standard | ~1,500 | + Main content, truncated examples |
| Full | Variable | Complete SKILL.md |
| Complete | Variable | + scripts/ + references/ |

### 0.10 Robot Mode: The AI-Native CLI Pattern

Every CLI tool in the flywheel ecosystem supports **robot mode**—machine-readable JSON output for programmatic consumption.

**Why robot mode is essential:**

1. **Agent tool use:** LLMs can reliably parse JSON, not human-formatted tables
2. **Composability:** Tools can call other tools and process results
3. **Stability:** JSON schemas are versioned; human output changes frequently
4. **Completeness:** JSON includes metadata humans wouldn't want to see

**Robot mode convention:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 27 lines. commands: ms, ms, {, "results":, {, "id":.]

**Robot mode rules:**
- stdout = data only (valid JSON)
- stderr = diagnostics, progress, errors
- Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = failure
- Schema documented and versioned

### 0.11 The Problem ms Solves

**Current state (without ms):**

1. **Skill creation is manual:** Writing skills (spec + compiled SKILL.md) from scratch requires:
   - Remembering what patterns worked
   - Articulating tacit knowledge explicitly
   - Formatting correctly for Claude Code
   - Testing and iterating

2. **Skills are scattered:** Stored in various places:
   - `~/.claude/skills/`
   - `.claude/skills/` in projects
   - Random GitHub repos
   - Local directories

3. **No discovery:** No way to search skills by content or find related skills

4. **No sharing infrastructure:** Sharing skills requires manual file copying

5. **No learning loop:** Successful coding sessions don't automatically improve skills

**Future state (with ms):**

1. **Skill creation from history:**
   ```bash
   ms build --from-cass "how I debug memory leaks"
   # Mines sessions, extracts patterns, generates skill draft
   # Interactive refinement until satisfied
   # Published skill captures real-world patterns
   ```

2. **Unified registry:**
   ```bash
   ms index  # Discovers all skills from configured paths
   ms search "async error"  # Finds relevant skills instantly
   ```

3. **Context-aware suggestions:**
   ```bash
   ms suggest --cwd /data/projects/rust-api
   # Suggests skills based on project type, current files, recent commands
   ```

4. **Sharing infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   ms bundle create my-rust-skills --tags rust
   ms bundle publish my-rust-skills --repo user/skill-bundle
   # Others install with:
   ms bundle install user/skill-bundle
   ```

5. **Learning flywheel:**
   - Agents work → Sessions recorded by CASS
   - ms mines CASS → Skills generated
   - Skills loaded → Agents work better
   - Better work → Better sessions → Repeat

### 0.12 Key Terminology Reference

### 0.13 Reference Implementations

This plan draws from three production codebases:

**1. xf (X Archive Search)** — `/data/projects/xf`
- ~23,000 LOC Rust
- SQLite + Tantivy + hash embeddings
- Auto-update via GitHub Releases
- Robot mode JSON output
- *Contribution:* Overall architecture, search, CLI patterns

**2. CASS (Coding Agent Session Search)** — `/data/projects/coding_agent_session_search`

- Robot mode API
- *Contribution:* Session mining, pattern extraction integration

**3. Agent Mail** — `/data/projects/mcp_agent_mail`

### 0.14 Success Criteria for This Plan

This plan should enable:

1. **Complete understanding:** A reader unfamiliar with these tools can evaluate the plan
2. **Implementation guidance:** An LLM can implement ms following this plan
3. **Architecture decisions:** Trade-offs are documented with rationale
4. **Testable milestones:** Each phase has clear deliverables
5. **Extension points:** Future features have designated integration points

### 0.15 Real-World Motivating Example: The UI/UX Polish Session

This example from an actual session illustrates exactly what ms should extract and generalize:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 20 lines.]

**What ms extracts from this session:**

| Specific Instance | Generalized Pattern | Skill Category |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| "Added handleScroll() call on mount" | Check initial state on component mount | React Patterns |
| "Added prefersReducedMotion check" | Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion` | Accessibility |
| "Added aria-hidden on decorative icons" | Decorative elements need aria-hidden | Accessibility |
| "transition: all is too broad" | Use specific transition properties | CSS Best Practices |
| "Deep codebase audit" command | Systematic audit workflow | Review Methodology |

**The transformation:**
1. **Specific:** "I fixed this exact bug in hero.tsx"
2. **General:** "When reviewing React/Next.js UIs, always check for these 8 categories of issues"
3. **Skill:** A complete "nextjs-ui-polish" skill with checklists, examples, and THE EXACT PROMPTS

---

## 1. Vision & Philosophy

### 1.1 The Core Insight

Skills are crystallized wisdom from successful coding sessions. Instead of manually writing skills from scratch, we can **mine existing session history** to extract patterns that actually worked. CASS already indexes thousands of coding sessions—ms transforms that raw material into polished, production-ready skills.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 10 lines.]

### 1.2 What ms Does

1. **Index** - Discover and catalog all skills across configured paths
2. **Load** - Progressive disclosure of skill content to agents
3. **Suggest** - Context-aware skill recommendations
4. **Bundle** - Package skills for sharing (GitHub, local, enterprise)
5. **Build** - The killer feature: generate skills from CASS sessions
6. **Maintain** - Auto-update, versioning, deprecation tracking

### 1.3 Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Follow xf exactly** | Same Rust patterns, same crate choices, same file layout |
| **SQLite + Git dual persistence** | From mcp_agent_mail: structured data in SQLite, human-readable in Git |
| **Robot mode everywhere** | Every command has `--robot` JSON output for automation |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Skills reveal depth as needed, not all at once |
| **Idempotent operations** | Safe to run any command multiple times |
| **Offline-first** | Full functionality without network, sync when available |

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 High-Level Components

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 24 lines.]

### 2.2 Data Flow

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 31 lines.]

### 2.3 File Layout (Following xf Pattern)

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 81 lines.]

**Runtime Artifacts:**
- `.ms/skillpack.bin` (or per-skill pack objects) caches parsed spec, slices,
  embeddings, and predicate analysis for low-latency load/suggest.
- Markdown remains a compiled view; runtime uses the pack by default.

---

## 3. Core Data Models

### 3.1 Skill Structure

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 489 lines. structs: Skill, SkillSpec, SkillSectionSpec, SpecLens, BlockLens, SkillMetadata; enums: SkillBlockSpec, Platform, NetworkRequirement, SkillLayer, PredicateType, VersionOp.]

### 3.2 SQLite Schema

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=sql, 337 lines. tables: skills, skill_aliases, skill_embeddings, skill_packs, skill_slices, skill_evidence; triggers: skills_ai, skills_ad, skills_au.]

### 3.3 Git Archive Structure (Human-Readable Persistence)

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 45 lines.]

### 3.4 Dependency Graph and Resolution

Skills declare dependencies (`requires`), capabilities (`provides`), and environment requirements
(platforms, tools, env vars) in metadata.
ms builds a dependency graph to resolve load order, detect cycles, and auto-load prerequisites.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 47 lines. structs: DependencyGraph, DependencyEdge, ResolvedDependencyPlan, SkillLoadPlan, DependencyResolver; enums: DependencyLoadMode.]

Default behavior: `ms load` uses `DependencyLoadMode::Auto` (load dependencies
at `overview` disclosure, root skill at the requested level).

#### 3.4.1 Skill Aliases and Deprecation

Renames are inevitable. ms preserves backward compatibility by maintaining
alias mappings (old id → canonical id) and surfacing deprecations with explicit
replacements.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 19 lines. structs: AliasResolver, AliasResolution.]

**Behavior:**
- `ms load legacy-id` resolves to canonical skill and emits a warning if deprecated.
- `ms search` and `ms suggest` exclude deprecated skills by default unless explicitly requested.
- If `deprecated.replaced_by` is set, ms highlights the replacement in output.
- Indexing upserts alias records from `metadata.aliases` and from `deprecated.replaced_by`
  (alias_type = `deprecated`), and rejects collisions with existing skill ids.

### 3.5 Layering and Conflict Resolution

Skills can exist in multiple layers. Higher layers override lower layers when
conflicts occur.

Layer order (default):
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 1 lines.]

**Layered Skill Registry:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 52 lines. structs: LayeredRegistry, ResolvedSkill, ConflictDetail; enums: ConflictStrategy, MergeStrategy, ConflictResolution.]

**Resolution Rules:**
- If only one layer provides a skill, use it directly.
- If multiple layers provide the same skill id:
  - Prefer higher layer by default
  - If both edit the same section, record a conflict detail
  - If conflict strategy is `interactive`, require explicit choice
  - If merge strategy is `prefer_sections`, keep higher-layer rules/pitfalls but
    append or preserve lower-layer examples/references when non-identical

**Conflict Auto-Diff and Merge Policies:**

To reduce manual resolution, ms computes section-level diffs and applies a
merge policy before falling back to interactive mode.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 45 lines. structs: ConflictMerger.]

When conflicts remain, ms surfaces a guided diff in `ms resolve` showing the
exact section differences and suggested merges.

**Block-Level Overlays:**

Beyond whole-skill overrides, higher layers can provide **overlay files** that patch
specific block IDs without copying the entire skill. This enables surgical policy
additions and reduces duplication/drift.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 67 lines. structs: SkillOverlay; enums: OverlayOp.]

**Overlay File Format:**

Overlays are stored in the layer's skill directory as `skill.overlay.json`:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=json, 23 lines. keys: skill_id, operations, type, block_id, content, type.]

**Benefits:**

- **No duplication:** Org/user layers don't copy entire skills
- **Drift prevention:** Base skill updates propagate automatically
- **Surgical policy:** Add compliance rules without rewriting
- **Clear provenance:** Each block records which layer modified it

### 3.6 Skill Spec and Deterministic Compilation

SKILL.md is a rendered artifact. The source-of-truth is a structured `SkillSpec`
that can be deterministically compiled into SKILL.md. This ensures reproducible
output, stable diffs, and safe automated edits.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 25 lines. structs: SkillCompiler; enums: CompileTarget.]

By default, `ms build` outputs `skill.spec.json`, then compiles it to SKILL.md.
SKILL.md is always generated; direct edits are blocked by default.

**Round-Trip Editing (Spec ↔ Markdown):**
- `ms edit <skill>` opens a structured view, parses edits back into `SkillSpec`,
  and re-renders `SKILL.md` deterministically.
- `ms edit --import-markdown` (or `ms repair`) can ingest Markdown diffs into
  spec with warnings and a provenance note, but remains opt-in.
- The compiler emits `spec.lens.json` to map block IDs to byte ranges so edits
  can be attributed to the correct spec blocks.
- If parsing fails, `--allow-lossy` permits a best-effort import with warnings.
- `ms fmt` re-renders from spec; `ms diff --semantic` compares spec blocks.

**Agent Adapters (Multi-Target Compile):**
- `ms compile --target claude|openai|cursor|generic-md`
- Same `SkillSpec`, different frontmatter and optional tool-call hints.

**Semantic Diff Everywhere:**
- `ms review <skill>` shows spec-level changes grouped by rule type.
- Conflict resolution and bundle updates default to semantic diffs.

**Runtime Skillpack Cache:**
- On `ms index`, emit `.ms/skillpack.bin` (or per-skill pack objects) containing:
  parsed spec, pre-tokenized slices, embeddings, predicate pre-analysis, and
  provenance pointers for low-latency `ms suggest/load`.

### 3.7 Two-Phase Commit for Dual Persistence

All writes that touch both SQLite and Git are wrapped in a lightweight two-phase
commit to avoid split-brain states.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 32 lines. structs: TxManager, TxRecord.]

Recovery is automatic on startup and via `ms doctor --fix`.

### 3.7.1 Global File Locking

While SQLite handles internal concurrency with WAL mode, the dual-persistence
pattern (SQLite + Git) requires coordination when multiple `ms` processes run
concurrently (e.g., parallel agent invocations, IDE background indexer + CLI).

**Optional Single-Writer Daemon (`msd`):**
- Holds hot indices/caches in memory and serializes writes.
- CLI becomes a thin client when daemon is running (lower p95 latency).

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 119 lines. structs: GlobalLock.]

**Locked TxManager:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 22 lines.]

**Lock behavior by command:**

| Command | Lock Type | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `ms index` | Exclusive | Bulk writes to both stores |
| `ms load` | None (read-only) | SQLite WAL handles read concurrency |
| `ms search` | None (read-only) | FTS queries are read-only |
| `ms suggest` | None (read-only) | Query-only operation |
| `ms edit` | Exclusive | Modifies SkillSpec, re-renders SKILL.md, updates SQLite |
| `ms mine` | Exclusive | Writes new skills |
| `ms calibrate` | Exclusive | Updates rule strengths |
| `ms doctor --fix` | Exclusive | May modify both stores |

**Diagnostics:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 8 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms.]

The lock file includes a JSON payload with holder PID and timestamp, enabling
stale lock detection (process no longer running) and diagnostics.

### 4.8 MCP Server Mode

Beyond CLI, ms provides a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for native agent
tool-use integration. This eliminates subprocess overhead, PATH issues, JSON parsing
brittleness, and platform differences.

**Why MCP matters:** CLI + JSON parsing works but is brittle. MCP is the native
interface for agent tool calling. Every modern agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor)
can consume ms via MCP with dramatically less friction.

**Server Commands:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 8 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms.]

**MCP Tool Definitions:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 55 lines. structs: MsSearch, MsSuggest, MsLoad, MsEvidence, MsBuildStatus, MsPack.]

**Server Architecture:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 30 lines. structs: McpServer.]

**Benefits over CLI:**

| Aspect | CLI Mode | MCP Mode |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Latency | ~50-100ms subprocess | ~1-5ms in-process |
| Caching | Per-invocation | Shared across requests |
| Streaming | Not supported | Partial results supported |
| Error handling | Exit codes + stderr | Structured error responses |
| Type safety | JSON schema drift risk | Schema-validated tools |

### 5.4 Interactive Build Session Flow

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 62 lines.]

### 5.5 The Guided Iterative Mode (Hours-Long Autonomous Skill Generation)

This is a **killer feature**: ms can run autonomously for hours, systematically mining your session history to produce a comprehensive skill library tailored to YOUR approach.

**The Problem It Solves:**
- Manual skill creation is tedious and incomplete
- You've solved thousands of problems but captured none of them
- Your personal patterns and preferences aren't documented anywhere
- Starting from scratch means rediscovering solutions you already found

**The Vision:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 37 lines.]

**Shared State Machine (Guided vs Autonomous):**
- Guided mode and autonomous mode share the same state machine.
- Autonomous = guided with zero user input; guided = autonomous with checkpoints.
- One recovery path reduces drift and improves reliability.

**Steady-State Detection:**

From your planning-workflow skill, we adopt the "iterate until steady state" pattern:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 117 lines. structs: SteadyStateDetector; enums: SteadyStateResult.]

**Autonomous Quality Rubric:**

The guided mode self-critiques each draft against this rubric:

| Criterion | Weight | Check |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Token Density** | 25% | Information per token exceeds threshold |
| **Actionability** | 25% | Contains concrete commands/code, not just advice |
| **Structure** | 20% | Has CRITICAL RULES, examples, troubleshooting |
| **Specificity** | 15% | References YOUR patterns, not generic wisdom |
| **Completeness** | 15% | Covers topic without obvious gaps |

**Interactive Checkpoints:**

Even in autonomous mode, ms pauses for user input at key moments:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 16 lines. enums: CheckpointTrigger.]

**CLI Interface:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 14 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms, ms, ms.]

### 5.6 Specific-to-General Transformation Algorithm

This is the core intellectual innovation: extracting universal patterns ("inner truths") from specific instances.
The same pipeline is applied to counter-examples to produce "Avoid / When NOT to use" rules.

**The Transformation Pipeline:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 52 lines.]

**Optional LLM-Assisted Refinement (Pluggable):**
- If configured, a local model critiques the candidate generalization for overreach,
  ambiguous scope, or missing counter-examples.
- Critique summaries are stored with the uncertainty item so humans can adjudicate.
- If no model is available, the pipeline remains heuristic-only.

**The Algorithm:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 157 lines. structs: SpecificToGeneralTransformer, RefinementCritique; traits: GeneralizationRefiner.]

**Generalization Confidence Scoring:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 75 lines. structs: GeneralizationValidation, CounterExample; enums: CounterExampleReason.]

**Stack-Specific Mining:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 8 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms.]

### 5.9 The Meta Skill Concept

The **meta skill** is a special skill that guides AI agents in using `ms` itself. This creates a recursive self-improvement loop where agents use skills to build better skills.

#### The Core Insight

**Progress Output Example:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 48 lines.]

### 5.11 Session Marking for Skill Mining

Allow users to mark sessions during or after completion as good candidates for skill extraction. This creates explicit training data for skill generation.

#### The Session Marking Problem

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 15 lines.]

#### Marking Data Model

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 180 lines. structs: SessionMark, SessionHighlight, SessionMarkStore; enums: MarkType, HighlightType.]

#### CLI Commands for Session Marking

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 35 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms, ms, ms, ms.]

#### Integration with Skill Building

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 41 lines. structs: MarkedSessionBuilder.]

**Example Workflow:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 21 lines. commands: $, --reason, --quality, $, $, $.]

Anti-pattern markings are treated as counter-examples and flow into a dedicated
"Avoid / When NOT to use" section during draft generation.

### 5.12 Evidence and Provenance Graph

Evidence links are first-class: every rule in a generated skill should be traceable back
to concrete session evidence. ms builds a lightweight provenance graph that connects:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 1 lines.]

This makes skills auditable, merge-safe, and self-correcting.

**Provenance Compression (Pointer + Fetch):**
- Level 0: hash pointers + message ranges (cheap default)
- Level 1: minimal redacted excerpt for quick review
- Level 2: expandable context fetched from CASS on demand

**Provenance Graph Model:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 42 lines. structs: ProvenanceGraph, ProvNode, ProvEdge, EvidenceTimeline, TimelineItem; enums: ProvNodeType.]

**CLI Examples:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 10 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms, ms, ms.]

**Actionable Evidence Navigation:**

Provenance is only valuable if humans can quickly validate and refine rules.
ms provides direct jump-to-source workflows that call CASS to expand context.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 74 lines. structs: EvidenceNavigator, ExpandedEvidence, ExpandedEvidenceItem.]

**Jump-to-Source CLI:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 14 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms, ms, ms.]

### 5.13 Redaction and Privacy Guard

All CASS transcripts pass through a redaction pipeline before pattern extraction.
This prevents secrets, tokens, and PII from ever entering generated skills,
evidence excerpts, or provenance graphs.

**Reassembly Resistance:**
- Redaction assigns stable `secret_id` values so multiple partial excerpts cannot
  be combined to reconstruct a secret across rules/evidence.
- High-risk secret types are blocked from excerpt storage entirely.

**Redaction Report Model:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 57 lines. structs: RedactionReport, RedactionFinding, RedactionLocation; enums: RedactionKind, SecretType, RedactionRisk.]

**Redactor Interface:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 15 lines. structs: Redactor.]

**CLI Examples:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 5 lines. commands: ms, ms.]

**Taint Tracking Through Mining Pipeline:**

Beyond binary redaction, ms tracks **taint labels** through the entire extraction →
clustering → synthesis pipeline. This ensures unsafe provenance never leaks into
high-leverage artifacts (prompts, rules, scripts).

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 80 lines. structs: TaintSet, TaintedSnippet, TaintTracker; enums: TaintSource.]

**Taint Policy Enforcement:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 27 lines. structs: TaintPolicy.]

**CLI Integration:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 8 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms.]

### 5.14 Anti-Pattern Mining and Counter-Examples

Great skills include what *not* to do. ms extracts anti-patterns from failure
signals, marked anti-pattern sessions, and explicit “wrong” fixes in transcripts.
These are presented as a dedicated "Avoid / When NOT to use" section and sliced
as `Pitfall` blocks for token packing.

**Symmetric Counterexample Pipeline:**
- Counterexamples are first-class patterns: extraction → clustering → synthesis → packing.
- Link each anti-pattern to the positive rule it constrains (conditionalization).

**Anti-Pattern Extraction Sources:**
- Session marks with `MarkType::AntiPattern`
- Failure outcomes from the effectiveness loop
- Phrases indicating incorrect or insecure approaches

**Draft Integration (example):**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 7 lines.]

### 5.15 Active-Learning Uncertainty Queue

When generalization confidence is too low, ms does not discard the pattern. Instead,
it queues the candidate for targeted evidence gathering. This turns "maybe" patterns
into high-quality rules with minimal extra effort.

**Precision Loop (Active Learning):**
- Generate 3–7 targeted CASS queries per uncertainty (positive, negative, boundary).
- Auto-run when idle or via `ms uncertainties --mine` and stop on confidence threshold.

**Uncertainty Queue Flow:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 1 lines.]

**Queue Interface:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 114 lines. structs: UncertaintyItem, DecisionBoundary, UncertaintyQueue; enums: MissingSignal, ResolutionCheck.]

**CLI Examples:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 8 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms.]

### 5.16 Session Quality Scoring

Not all sessions are equally useful. ms scores sessions for signal quality and
filters out low-quality transcripts before pattern extraction.

**Session Quality Model:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 38 lines. structs: SessionQuality.]

**Usage:**
- Default threshold: `cass.min_session_quality`
- Use `--min-session-quality` to override per build
- Marked sessions (exemplary) get a quality bonus

---

### 5.17 Prompt Injection Defense

ms filters prompt-injection content before pattern extraction. Any session messages
that attempt to override system rules or instruct the agent to ignore constraints
are quarantined and excluded by default.

**Primary Defense: ACIP Integration (v1.3 recommended):**
- Use **ACIP** from `/data/projects/acip` as the canonical injection defense framework.
- Support three modes: direct inclusion, checker-model gate, or hybrid audit mode.
- Audit mode uses `ACIP_AUDIT_MODE=ENABLED` tags for operator visibility.
- Pin ACIP version in config and store provenance alongside injection reports.

**Forensic Quarantine Playback:**
- Store snippet hash, minimal safe excerpt, triggered rule, and replay command.
- Replay requires explicit user invocation to expand context from CASS.

**Injection Report Model:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 45 lines. structs: InjectionReport, AcipConfig, InjectionGate, InjectionFinding; enums: InjectionSeverity.]

**CLI Examples:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 2 lines. commands: ms, ms.]

---

### 5.18 Safety Invariant Layer (No Destructive Ops)

ms enforces a hard invariant: destructive filesystem or git operations are never
executed without explicit, verbatim approval. This mirrors the global agent
rules and prevents ms from becoming a footgun.

**Primary Enforcement: DCG Integration:**
- Integrate **Destructive Command Guard (DCG)** from `/data/projects/destructive_command_guard`
  as the primary runtime guard for destructive commands.
- Leverage DCG’s pack system, heredoc/inline script scanning, explain mode, and
  fail‑open design rather than re‑implementing command semantics in ms.

**Safety Policy Model:**

Safety classification is **effect-based**, not command-string-based. Rather than
pattern-matching on strings like `rm` or `git reset`, we classify by the semantic
effect of what the command does. This is more robust because:
- `rm -rf /` and `find . -delete` have the same effect (file deletion)
- A command with harmless flags (e.g., `rm -i`) is safer than one without
- Novel commands get correct classification based on what they do

**Non-Removable Policy Lenses:**
- Compile critical policies into `Policy` slices and include them via
  `MandatoryPredicate::OfType(SliceType::Policy)` in pack constraints.
- `MandatoryPredicate::Always` is reserved for global invariants (rare).
- Packer fails closed if policy slices are omitted under any pack budget.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 106 lines. structs: SafetyPolicy, ApprovalRequest, DcgGuard, DcgDecision, CommandSafetyEvent; enums: CommandEffect, SafetyTier, DestructiveOpsPolicy.]

**Behavior:**
- Destructive commands (delete/overwrite/reset) are blocked by default.
- In robot mode, ms returns `approval_required` with the exact approve hint.
- In human mode, ms prompts for the exact verbatim command string.
- In ms-managed directories, deletions become **tombstones** (content-addressed
  markers); actual pruning is only performed when explicitly invoked.

**Robot Approval Example:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=json, 12 lines. keys: status, approval_required, approve_command, tier, reason, timestamp.]

## 6. Progressive Disclosure System

### 6.1 Disclosure Levels

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 37 lines. enums: DisclosureLevel.]

### 6.2 Disclosure Logic

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 80 lines. structs: TokenBudget; enums: DisclosurePlan, PackMode.]

### 6.3 Context-Aware Disclosure

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 37 lines.]

**Disclosure Context (partial):**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 9 lines. structs: DisclosureContext.]

### 6.4 Micro-Slicing and Token Packing

To maximize signal per token, ms pre-slices skills into atomic blocks (rules,
commands, examples, pitfalls). A packer then selects the highest-utility slices
that fit within a token budget.

**Slice Generation Heuristics:**

- One slice per rule, command block, example, checklist, pitfall, or policy invariant
- Preserve section headings by attaching them to the first slice in the section
- Estimate tokens per slice using a fast tokenizer heuristic
- Assign utility score from quality signals + usage frequency + evidence coverage
- Propagate tags from skill metadata and block annotations into slices

**Token Packer (Constrained Optimization):**

The packer treats slice selection as a constrained optimization problem, not just
greedy selection. This ensures predictable coverage, safer packs, and stable behavior.

**Constraints:**
- Total tokens ≤ budget
- Dependencies satisfied before dependents
- Coverage quotas (e.g., at least 1 from "critical-rules" group)
- Max per group (avoid over-representing one category)
- Risk tier constraints (always include safety warnings)

**Objective:** Maximize total utility with diminishing returns per group.

**Injection-Time Optimization:**
- Apply novelty penalties vs. already-loaded slices in the current prompt/context.
- Boost missing facets (e.g., pitfalls/validation) based on task fingerprint.

**Pack Contracts:**
- `DebugContract`, `RefactorContract`, etc. define mandatory groups/slices.
- Packer fails closed if contract cannot be satisfied within budget.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 273 lines. structs: PackConstraints, CoverageQuota, ConstrainedPacker, PackResult; enums: MandatorySlice, MandatoryPredicate, PackError.]

**CLI Example:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 1 lines. commands: ms.]

### 6.5 Conditional Block Predicates

Skills often contain version-specific or environment-specific content. Rather than
maintaining separate skills or relying on the agent to reason about versions,
ms supports **block-level predicates** that strip irrelevant content at load time.

**Markdown Syntax:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=markdown, 3 lines.]

**Predicate Types:**

| Predicate | Example | Evaluates |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `package:<name> <op> <version>` | `package:next >= 16.0.0` | package.json / Cargo.toml version |
| `tool:<name> <op> <version>` | `tool:node >= 18.0.0` | Installed tool version |
| `rust:edition <op> <year>` | `rust:edition == 2021` | Cargo.toml rust edition |
| `env:<var>` | `env:CI` | Environment variable presence |
| `file:<pattern>` | `file:src/middleware.ts` | File/glob existence |

**Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` (semver-aware for versions)

**Evaluation Flow:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 43 lines.]

**Why This Matters:**

The agent *cannot* hallucinate using deprecated patterns because those patterns
are physically absent from its context window. This directly addresses the
version drift problem (e.g., Next.js middleware.ts vs proxy.ts) mentioned in
AGENTS.md without requiring separate skills or complex agent reasoning.

**CLI Example:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 5 lines. commands: ms, ms.]

### 6.6 Meta-Skills: Composed Slice Bundles

Agents rarely need a single skill—they need **task kits** combining slices from
multiple related skills. Meta-skills are first-class compositions that persist
and evolve.

**Why Meta-Skills:**

| Without Meta-Skills | With Meta-Skills |
|---------------------|------------------|
| `ms load nextjs-ui && ms load a11y && ms load react-patterns` | `ms load frontend-polish` |
| Manual coordination of 4+ skills | Single load, optimal packing |
| Repeated setup per session | Battle-tested bundle |

**Data Model:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 41 lines. structs: MetaSkill, MetaSkillSliceRef; enums: PinStrategy.]

**CLI Commands:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 20 lines. commands: ms, --from, --from, --from, ms, ms.]

**Resolution and Packing:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 36 lines.]

**Use Cases:**

- **NTM integration:** Define meta-skills per bead type (e.g., `ui-polish-bead`, `api-refactor-bead`)
- **Onboarding:** Ship `team-standards` meta-skill bundling all org-required rules
- **Tech stack kits:** `rust-cli-complete`, `nextjs-fullstack`, `go-microservice`

---

## 7. Search & Suggestion Engine

### 7.1 Hybrid Search (Following xf Pattern)

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 47 lines. structs: HybridSearcher.]

**Alias + Deprecation Handling:**
- If the query exactly matches a skill alias, ms resolves to the canonical skill id.
- Deprecated skills are filtered out by default (use `--include-deprecated` to show them).

### 7.2 Context-Aware Suggestion

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 141 lines. structs: Suggester.]

When `--for-ntm` is used, `ms suggest` returns `swarm_plan` in robot mode so
each agent can load a complementary slice pack instead of duplicating content.

**Bandit-Weighted Signal Selection:**
- A contextual bandit learns per-project weighting over signals (bm25, embeddings,
  triggers, freshness, project match) using usage/outcome rewards.
- Replaces static tuning with adaptive, self-optimizing retrieval.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 5 lines. structs: SignalBandit.]

**Suggestion Context (partial):**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 13 lines. structs: SuggestionContext.]

**Requirement-aware suggestions:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 99 lines. structs: EnvironmentSnapshot, RequirementStatus, RequirementChecker; enums: NetworkStatus.]

**Collective Pack Planning (Swarm / NTM):**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 51 lines. structs: SwarmContext, SwarmPlan, AgentPack; enums: PackObjective, SwarmRole.]

### 7.2.1 Context Fingerprints & Suggestion Cooldowns

To prevent `ms suggest` from spamming the same skills repeatedly when context hasn't meaningfully changed, we compute a **context fingerprint** and maintain a cooldown cache.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 95 lines. structs: ContextFingerprint.]

**Cooldown Cache:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 116 lines. structs: SuggestionCooldownCache.]

**Integration with Suggester:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 72 lines. structs: CooldownConfig, SuggestionResult.]

**CLI flags:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 11 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms, ms.]

This mechanism prevents suggestion spam in tight loops (e.g., IDE integrations calling `ms suggest` on every keystroke) while still responding to meaningful context changes like new commits, file edits, or command history.

### 7.3 Hash-Based Embeddings (From xf)

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 48 lines.]

### 7.3.1 Pluggable Embedding Backends

Hash embeddings are the default (fast, deterministic, zero dependencies). For
higher semantic fidelity, ms supports an optional local ML embedder.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 25 lines. structs: HashEmbedder, LocalMlEmbedder; traits: Embedder.]

**Selection Rules:**
- Default: `HashEmbedder`
- If `embeddings.backend = "local"` and model available → `LocalMlEmbedder`
- Fallback to hash if local model missing

### 7.4 Skill Quality Scoring Algorithm

Quality scoring determines which skills are most worth surfacing to agents. This section details the multi-factor scoring algorithm, including provenance (evidence coverage and confidence).

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 352 lines. structs: QualityScorer, QualityWeights, QualityScore, QualityFactors.]

**Quality Issue Types:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 29 lines. enums: QualityIssue.]

**CLI Integration:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 23 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms, ms, ms, ms.]

**Quality-Based Filtering:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 18 lines.]

---

### 7.5 Skill Pruning & Evolution

As the registry grows, ms must keep skills lean and current without destructive
deletions. Pruning is **proposal-first**: identify candidates, suggest merges
or deprecations, and require explicit confirmation before applying changes.

**Signals:**
- Low recent usage (e.g., <5 uses in 30 days)
- Low quality score (e.g., <0.3)
- High similarity to another skill (e.g., >= 0.8)
- Persistent toolchain mismatch or stale indicators

**Actions (non-destructive by default):**
- Propose merge: "Combine X and Y into Z" with auto-generated draft
- Propose deprecate: mark as deprecated + replacement alias
- Propose split: break overly broad skills into focused children
- Emit BV beads for review and scheduling

**CLI Example:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 8 lines. commands: ms, ms, ms.]

### 8.5 Multi-Machine Synchronization

Following the xf pattern for distributed archive access across multiple development machines.

**RU (repo_updater) Integration:**
- Use `/data/projects/repo_updater` as the repo‑level sync backend for skill sources.
- RU syncs GitHub repos; ms indexes/merges at the skill level.
- When RU finishes a sync, trigger `ms index` to refresh skills deterministically.
- Bead cross‑reference: `meta_skill-327` (RU integration) depends on
  `meta_skill-ujr` and `meta_skill-yu1` (blocks).

## 12. Dependencies (Cargo.toml)

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=toml, 74 lines. sections: package, dependencies, dev-dependencies, profile.release.]

## 13. Key Design Decisions

### 13.1 Why Hash Embeddings Instead of ML Models

| ML Embeddings | Hash Embeddings |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Requires model download (100MB+) | Zero dependencies |
| GPU/CPU inference overhead | Pure CPU, instant |
| Version lock-in | Always reproducible |
| Network dependency for updates | Fully offline |
| Black box | Transparent algorithm |

The hash embedding approach from xf provides 80-90% of ML embedding quality for skill matching, with none of the operational complexity.
For teams that need higher semantic fidelity, ms supports an **optional local ML embedder**
that is still offline and fully opt-in.

### 13.2 Why SQLite + Git Dual Persistence

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 17 lines.]

**Two-Phase Commit for Consistency**

To avoid partial writes (SQLite updated but Git not, or vice versa), ms wraps every
write in a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol with a durable write-ahead record.

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 12 lines.]

This makes dual persistence crash-safe and idempotent.

### 13.3 Why Interactive Build Over Fully Automated

The iterative, interactive build process is essential because:

1. **Quality requires judgment** - Not all extracted patterns are good
2. **Context is king** - Human knows what's actually useful
3. **Refinement improves output** - Each iteration focuses the skill
4. **Learning opportunity** - User sees what patterns exist in their sessions

Fully automated mode (`--auto`) is available for pipelines, but interactive is the default for quality.

## 18. Testing Strategy

### 18.1 Testing Philosophy

Following Rust best practices with comprehensive coverage across unit, integration, and property-based tests.

**UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner) Integration:**
- Integrate `/data/projects/ultimate_bug_scanner` as a required quality gate.
- Run `ubs` on changed files before commits and during CI; surface findings in `ms doctor`.
- Prefer machine-readable outputs (JSON/SARIF) for automation and bead creation.

**UBS Data Model:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 22 lines. structs: UbsConfig, UbsFinding, UbsReport.]

**Testing Beads Coverage:**
- Create dedicated beads for unit tests, integration tests, E2E scripts, and benchmarks.
- Treat testing beads as first-class blockers in planning/triage.

## 20. Agent Mail Integration for Multi-Agent Skill Coordination

### 20.1 Overview

The `ms` CLI integrates with the Agent Mail MCP server to enable multi-agent skill coordination. When multiple agents work on the same project, they need to:

1. **Share discovered patterns** in real-time
2. **Coordinate skill generation** to avoid duplication
3. **Request skills** from other agents who may have relevant expertise
4. **Notify** when new skills are ready for use

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 25 lines.]

### 20.2 Agent Mail Client Integration

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 167 lines. structs: AgentMailClient, SkillRequestBounty; enums: SkillRequestUrgency.]

**Reservation-Aware Editing (Fallback):**
- If Agent Mail is unavailable, ms provides a local reservation mechanism with
  compatible semantics (path/glob, TTL, exclusive/shared).
- When Agent Mail is available, ms bridges to it transparently.

### 20.3 Coordination Protocol

### 26.4 CASS Query Patterns for Skill Mining

**Effective queries discovered:**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 16 lines. commands: cass, cass, cass, cass, cass, cass.]

**Query expansion strategy:**
1. Start with exact phrase: `"inner truth"`
2. Expand to component terms: `inner`, `truth`, `abstract`
3. Add synonyms: `general`, `principles`, `universal`
4. Add domain context: `pattern`, `extract`, `lesson`

### 26.6 Future CASS Integration Enhancements

Based on mining experience, these CASS features would improve skill generation:

1. **Semantic clustering API**: `cass cluster --by-topic --limit 10`
2. **Cross-session patterns**: `cass patterns --min-occurrences 3`
3. **Project filtering**: `cass search "query" --workspace /data/projects/brenner_bot`
4. **Time-range filtering**: `cass search "query" --since "2025-12-01"`
5. **Agent filtering**: `cass search "query" --agent claude_code`

## Section 28: The Brenner Method for Skill Extraction

*CASS Mining Deep Dive: brenner_bot methodology (P0 bead: meta_skill-4d7)*

### 28.1 Core Insight: Reverse-Engineering Cognitive Architectures

The brenner_bot project provides a methodology for extracting **actionable skills** from CASS sessions. Key insight: **don't summarize—extract the generative grammar**.

> "This is not a summary... It is an attempt to **reverse-engineer the cognitive architecture** that generated those contributions—to find the generative grammar of his thinking."

**Application to meta_skill:** We're not looking for "what happened"—we're looking for **repeatable cognitive moves** that made work successful. These become skills.

### 28.2 The Two Axioms for Skill Extraction

#### Axiom 1: Effective Coding Has a Generative Grammar
Code changes are *generated* by cognitive moves that can be identified and formalized.

#### Axiom 2: Understanding = Ability to Reproduce
A skill is valid only if you can **execute it on new problems**.

### 28.3 The Brenner Loop for Skill Extraction

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 8 lines.]

### 28.4 Skill Tags (Operator Algebra)

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| ProblemSelection | How to pick what to work on |
| HypothesisSlate | Explicit enumeration of approaches |
| ThirdAlternative | Both approaches could be wrong |
| IterativeRefinement | Multi-round improvement |
| RuthlessKill | Abandoning failing approaches |
| Quickie | Pilot experiments to de-risk |
| MaterializationInstinct | "What would I see if true?" |
| InnerTruth | The generalizable principle |

### 28.5 Key Methodological Insights

1. **Seven-Cycle Log Paper Test**: If improvement isn't obvious, skill needs refinement
2. **Multi-Model Triangulation**: Extract from multiple angles, keep convergent patterns
3. **Don't Worry Hypothesis**: Document gaps, don't block on secondary concerns
4. **Exception Quarantine**: Collect failures first, look for patterns before patching

## Section 29: APR Iterative Refinement Patterns

*CASS Mining Deep Dive: automated_plan_reviser_pro methodology (P1 bead: meta_skill-hzg)*

### 29.1 The Numerical Optimizer Analogy

The APR project reveals a powerful insight: **iterative specification refinement follows the same dynamics as numerical optimization**.

> "It very much reminds me of a numerical optimizer gradually converging on a steady state after wild swings in the initial iterations."

**Application to meta_skill:** When building skills through CASS mining, expect early iterations to produce wild swings (major restructures, foundational changes). Later iterations converge on stable formulations. Don't judge early work—judge the convergence trajectory.

### 29.2 The Convergence Pattern

Refinement progresses through predictable phases:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 9 lines.]

| Phase | Rounds | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Major Fixes** | 1-3 | Security gaps, architectural flaws, fundamental issues |
| **Architecture** | 4-7 | Interface improvements, component boundaries |
| **Refinement** | 8-12 | Edge cases, optimizations, nuanced handling |
| **Polishing** | 13+ | Final abstractions, converging on steady state |

**Key insight:** In early rounds, reviewers focus on "putting out fires." Once major issues are addressed, they can apply "considerable intellectual energies on nuanced particulars."

### 29.3 Convergence Analytics Algorithm

APR implements a quantitative convergence detector using three weighted signals:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 1 lines.]

| Signal | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Output Size Trend** | 35% | Are responses getting shorter? Early rounds produce lengthy analyses; convergence shows as more focused, briefer feedback |
| **Change Velocity** | 35% | Is the rate of change slowing? Measured by comparing delta sizes between consecutive rounds |
| **Content Similarity** | 30% | Are successive rounds becoming more similar? Uses word-level overlap to detect stabilization |

**Interpretation:**
- **Score ≥ 0.75**: High confidence of convergence. The specification is stabilizing.
- **Score 0.50-0.74**: Moderate convergence. Significant work remains but progress is visible.
- **Score < 0.50**: Low convergence. Still in early iteration phase with major changes likely.

**Application to meta_skill:** When refining skills through CASS mining, track these metrics:
1. Are extracted patterns getting shorter/tighter?
2. Is the rate of changes to skill definitions slowing?
3. Are multi-model extractions converging on similar formulations?

### 29.4 Grounded Abstraction Principle

> "Every few rounds, including the implementation document keeps abstract specifications grounded in concrete reality."

**Pattern:** Every 3-4 rounds of abstract refinement, ground the work in concrete implementation:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 19 lines.]

**Application to meta_skill:** When extracting skills from CASS sessions, periodically test them:
- Can the skill actually be loaded and executed?
- Does the skill produce expected outputs?
- Do agents understand and apply the skill correctly?

### 29.5 Reliability Features for Long Operations

APR implements several reliability patterns for expensive operations:

#### Pre-Flight Validation
Check all preconditions before starting expensive work:
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 5 lines.]

**Application to meta_skill:** Before running expensive CASS operations:
- Verify index is up-to-date
- Check disk space for embeddings
- Validate query parameters
- Confirm output paths writable

#### Auto-Retry with Exponential Backoff
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 4 lines.]

**Application to meta_skill:** Retry transient failures (network, rate limits) with increasing delays.

#### Session Locking
Prevent concurrent operations that could cause corruption:
- File-based locks with timestamp
- Automatic stale lock cleanup
- Clear error messages on lock conflict

### 29.6 Dual Interface Pattern

APR serves two audiences with the same codebase:

| Audience | Interface | Features |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Humans** | Beautiful TUI | gum styling, interactive wizards, progress indicators, notifications |
| **Machines** | Robot Mode JSON | Structured output, semantic error codes, pre-flight validation |

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 14 lines. structs: OutputMode.]

**Semantic Error Codes:**
- `ok` - Success
- `not_configured` - No configuration found
- `not_found` - Resource doesn't exist
- `validation_failed` - Preconditions not met
- `dependency_missing` - Required dependency unavailable

### 29.7 Audit Trail Principle

Every operation creates artifacts:
- Output files saved to versioned directories
- Git integration for history
- Logs for debugging
- Metrics for analysis

**Application to meta_skill:**
- Every CASS mining session produces artifacts in `.ms_cache/`
- Extracted skills tracked in Git
- Operation logs preserved for debugging
- Convergence metrics stored for analysis

### 29.8 Design Principles Summary

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Iterative Convergence** | Like numerical optimization—expect wild swings early, convergence late |
| **Grounded Abstraction** | Periodically ground abstract work in concrete implementation |
| **Audit Trail** | Every operation creates artifacts; history is preserved |
| **Graceful Degradation** | Fallbacks for missing dependencies (gum → ANSI, global → npx) |
| **Dual Interface** | Beautiful for humans, structured for machines |
| **Secure by Default** | No credential storage, checksum verification, atomic operations |

## Section 30: Performance Profiling Patterns

*Source: CASS mining of local coding agent sessions - performance analysis workflows*

### 30.1 Introduction

Performance profiling is critical for building efficient CLI tools. This section synthesizes patterns from real-world performance optimization sessions, covering methodology, tooling, benchmarking, and specific optimization techniques.

### 30.2 Performance Analysis Methodology

A comprehensive performance analysis examines multiple dimensions:

#### Hot Path Identification
Focus analysis on the most frequently executed code:
- Query execution and caching
- Vector/similarity search operations
- Full-text index operations
- I/O pipelines (indexing, storage)
- Database operations
- Parser/connector code

#### Inefficiency Pattern Checklist

| Pattern | Description | Detection |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **N+1 Queries** | Fetching in loops | Profile shows repeated DB calls |
| **Unnecessary Allocations** | `String::new()`, `Vec::new()` in hot loops | Heap profiling |
| **Repeated Serialization** | serde overhead in loops | CPU profiling |
| **Linear Scans** | O(n) where hash/binary search works | Code review |
| **Lock Contention** | Mutex/RwLock blocking | Contention profiling |
| **Unbounded Collections** | Growing without limits | Memory profiling |
| **Missing Early Termination** | No short-circuiting | Code review |
| **Redundant Computation** | Same calculation repeated | Memoization analysis |
| **String Operations** | Could use interning | Allocation profiling |
| **Iterator Overhead** | Intermediate collections | Inspect `.collect()` calls |
| **Cache Misses** | Poor memory locality | `perf stat` cache metrics |

### 30.3 Algorithm and Data Structure Opportunities

#### Data Structure Upgrades

| Current | Opportunity | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| HashMap | Trie | Prefix operations, autocomplete |

| LRU cache | ARC/LFU | Frequency-biased caching |
| Deduplication | Union-find | Graph-based dedup |
| Cumulative ops | Prefix sums | Running totals |
| Sorting | Priority queue | Top-K selection |

During optimization:
- [ ] Make one change at a time
- [ ] Measure after each change
- [ ] Verify correctness with tests

After optimization:
- [ ] Document the improvement with benchmarks
- [ ] Add regression tests if performance is critical
- [ ] Consider adding benchmark to CI

## Section 31: Optimization Patterns and Methodology

*Source: CASS mining from optimization sessions across multiple codebases*

This section captures systematic optimization methodologies and specific optimization patterns discovered through CASS analysis of real-world performance work.

### 31.1 Optimization Methodology Framework

Before attempting any optimization, follow this disciplined methodology:

#### A) Baseline Establishment

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 8 lines. commands: cargo, time, cargo.]

**Key Principle**: Never optimize without knowing your starting point.

#### B) Profile Before Proposing

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 13 lines. commands: cargo, DHAT=1, strace, cargo, perf, perf.]

**Anti-pattern**: Optimizing based on intuition rather than profiling data.

#### C) Equivalence Oracle

Define explicit verification criteria before making changes:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 32 lines.]

#### D) Isomorphism Proof Per Change

Every optimization diff must include proof that outputs cannot change:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 11 lines.]

#### E) Opportunity Matrix

Rank optimizations by expected value:

| Opportunity | Impact (1-5) | Confidence (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Score |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| Replace Vec with SmallVec for N<8 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 15.0 |
| Parallelize with Rayon | 4 | 4 | 2 | 8.0 |
| Switch to FxHashMap | 2 | 5 | 1 | 10.0 |
| Implement SIMD dot product | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3.0 |
| Memory-map large files | 5 | 4 | 3 | 6.7 |

**Formula**: Score = (Impact × Confidence) / Effort

#### F) Minimal Diffs

One performance lever per commit:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 2 lines.]

Benefits:
- Easier to measure individual impact
- Easier to bisect regressions
- Easier to revert if problems arise

#### G) Regression Guardrails

Add benchmark thresholds to CI:

## Section 33: Error Handling Patterns and Methodology

*CASS-mined insights on robust error handling in Rust applications*

### 33.1 Error Handling Philosophy

Error handling in Rust differs fundamentally from exceptions in other languages. The key principles:

1. **Errors are values** - `Result<T, E>` makes errors explicit and composable
2. **Fail loudly, recover gracefully** - Errors should be visible but recoverable
3. **Context over raw messages** - Error chains explain *why*, not just *what*
4. **Match error types to boundaries** - Different error types for different layers

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 8 lines.]

### 33.2 The thiserror and anyhow Dichotomy

**thiserror** is for library code - create specific, matchable error types:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 35 lines. enums: SkillError.]

**anyhow** is for application code - rich context chains without ceremony:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 35 lines.]

### 33.3 Structured CLI Error Types

For CLI applications, create a structured error type that maps to exit codes:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 96 lines. structs: CliError.]

### 33.4 Error Taxonomy Patterns

For protocol or API libraries, define a comprehensive error taxonomy:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 110 lines. structs: FcpError.]

### 33.5 Error Context Chaining

Build rich error chains that explain the full failure path:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 44 lines.]

### 33.6 Error Recovery Patterns

Implement retry logic with exponential backoff:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 166 lines. structs: RetryConfig, CircuitBreaker.]

### 33.7 Panic vs Result Guidelines

**When to use panic (via `unwrap`, `expect`, `unreachable!`):**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 27 lines.]

**When to use Result (proper error handling):**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 37 lines.]

### 33.8 Error Boundary Patterns

For systems with multiple error domains, create clear boundaries:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 63 lines. enums: LibraryError, AppError.]

### 33.9 Error Logging Best Practices

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 40 lines.]

### 33.10 Application to meta_skill

| Error Category | Pattern | Example |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Skill Loading** | `thiserror` enum | `SkillError::NotFound`, `SkillError::ParseFailed` |
| **CLI Interface** | `CliError` struct | Exit codes, hints, retryable flags |
| **Template Rendering** | `anyhow` context | Rich failure chains |
| **External APIs** | `FcpError` taxonomy | Error codes, retry hints |
| **Network Operations** | Retry with backoff | `with_retry()` function |
| **Service Stability** | Circuit breaker | Prevent cascading failures |

### 33.11 Error Handling Checklist

Before shipping error handling:
- [ ] All public API functions return `Result` (not `Option` for errors)
- [ ] Error types are appropriate for the layer (library vs application)
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly (no raw technical jargon)
- [ ] Errors include actionable hints where possible
- [ ] Sensitive information is not leaked in error messages
- [ ] Errors are logged with appropriate severity
- [ ] Retryable errors are clearly marked
- [ ] Exit codes follow Unix conventions
- [ ] Error chains preserve the full context
- [ ] Panics only occur for programming errors, not user input
- [ ] Circuit breakers protect against cascading failures
- [ ] Retry logic includes jitter and backoff

## Section 34: Testing Patterns and Methodology

### 34.1 Testing Philosophy

#### The "NO Mocks" Principle

**Source**: CASS mining of brenner_bot testing landscape analysis

The observed philosophy is: **"NO mocks - test real implementations with real data fixtures."**

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 9 lines.]

**When to mock**:
1. **Animations**: Mock framer-motion to avoid flaky timing-dependent tests
2. **External APIs**: Stub fetch only when testing HTTP client behavior, not when testing business logic
3. **Time-dependent operations**: Use fakeable clocks, not mocked functions

**When NOT to mock**:
1. File system operations - use `t.TempDir()` (Go) or `mkdtempSync()` (JS)
2. Database operations - use in-memory SQLite or real temp databases
3. Internal functions - if you need to mock internal functions, the design needs refactoring

### 34.2 Test Organization Patterns

#### JavaScript/TypeScript (Vitest/Jest/Bun)

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 58 lines.]

#### Go Table-Driven Tests

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=go, 37 lines.]

#### Test File Naming Conventions

| Language | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **TypeScript** | `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx` | `copy.test.ts`, `Button.test.tsx` |
| **Go** | `*_test.go` | `evaluator_test.go` |
| **Rust** | `mod tests` in same file, or `/tests/*.rs` | `mod tests { ... }` |
| **Bash** | `*.bats` (BATS framework) | `test_utils.bats` |

### 34.3 Test Fixture Patterns

#### Real Filesystem Fixtures

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 38 lines.]

#### Go Test Fixtures with t.TempDir()

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=go, 21 lines.]

#### Environment Variable Isolation

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 16 lines.]

### 34.4 Property-Based Testing

#### Rust with proptest

**Source**: CASS mining of destructive_command_guard property tests

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 64 lines.]

#### Key Property Test Categories

| Property | What it tests | Example assertion |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Idempotence** | `f(f(x)) == f(x)` | Normalization, formatting |
| **Determinism** | Same input → same output | Evaluation, parsing |
| **Safety** | Never panics on any input | Error handling |
| **Bounds** | Handles edge sizes gracefully | Large inputs, empty inputs |
| **Commutativity** | Order doesn't matter | Set operations |
| **Invertibility** | `decode(encode(x)) == x` | Serialization |

|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Unit Tests** | Table-driven, real fixtures | Skill parsing, template rendering |
| **Integration Tests** | Real filesystem, temp dirs | Skill installation, config loading |
| **Property Tests** | proptest invariants | Template normalization, path handling |
| **E2E Tests** | CLI subprocess | Full workflow: search → select → copy |
| **Snapshot Tests** | Output verification | Rendered skill content |

### 34.13 Testing Checklist

Before shipping tests:
- [ ] Tests use real implementations, not mocks (except for animations/network)
- [ ] File operations use temp directories (`t.TempDir()` or `mkdtempSync()`)
- [ ] Environment variables are isolated and restored
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no reliance on timing, random values, or external state)
- [ ] Property tests cover invariants (idempotence, determinism, safety)
- [ ] Table-driven tests cover edge cases systematically
- [ ] E2E tests run on multiple browsers/platforms if applicable
- [ ] CI produces JUnit/TAP output for test reporting
- [ ] Flaky tests are marked or fixed (use `it.skip` with explanation)
- [ ] Test coverage gaps are documented and prioritized
- [ ] Snapshot tests are reviewed when updated
- [ ] Tests are organized by type (unit/, integration/, e2e/)

## Section 36: Caching and Memoization Patterns

**Source**: CASS mining of beads_viewer, xf, coding_agent_session_search, and related optimization sessions

### 36.1 Caching Philosophy

#### When to Cache

| Scenario | Cache Strategy | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Computed on demand, used multiple times** | Lazy accessor with memoization | `TriageContext.ActionableIssues()` |
| **Expensive computation, stable inputs** | Hash-keyed persistent cache | Graph metrics, embeddings |
| **Hot path, sub-millisecond latency required** | In-memory with TTL | API responses, search results |
| **Large dataset, memory-limited** | LRU eviction | File caches, database query results |
| **One-time initialization, immutable after** | `OnceLock` / `sync.Once` | Configuration, static indices |

#### Caching Anti-Patterns

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 5 lines.]

### 36.2 Lazy Initialization Patterns

#### Rust: OnceLock for Static Lazy Values

**Source**: CASS mining of xf VectorIndex cache

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 21 lines.]

**When to use**:
- Configuration that's expensive to compute
- Indices loaded on first access
- Runtime feature flags

#### Go: sync.Once for Thread-Safe Initialization

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=go, 27 lines.]

#### TypeScript: Lazy Accessor Pattern

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 28 lines.]

### 36.3 TriageContext Pattern: Unified Lazy Caching

**Source**: CASS mining of beads_viewer TriageContext implementation

This pattern provides a context object that lazily computes and caches multiple related values, avoiding redundant computation in complex workflows.

#### Go Implementation

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=go, 139 lines.]

#### Key Design Points

| Aspect | Implementation | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Lazy computation** | Check `computed` flag before work | Avoid redundant expensive calls |
| **Lookup optimization** | Build `Set` from `Slice` on first access | O(1) membership tests |
| **Thread safety** | Optional mutex via constructor | Single-threaded hot paths stay fast |
| **Internal methods** | `*Internal` methods don't acquire locks | Avoid deadlock from nested calls |
| **Cycle detection** | `visiting` map parameter | Handle graph cycles gracefully |
| **Reset capability** | Clear all cached state | Reuse context across operations |

### 36.4 Heap-Based Top-K Collectors

**Source**: CASS mining of beads_viewer topk utility and cass vector search

For selecting the top K items from a stream or large collection, a min-heap is more efficient than full sorting: O(n log k) vs O(n log n).

#### Go Generic Implementation

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=go, 117 lines.]

#### Rust BinaryHeap Implementation

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 82 lines. structs: TopKCollector, ScoredEntry.]

#### Complexity Comparison

| Operation | sort.Slice | Heap-based Top-K |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Time | O(n log n) | O(n log k) |
| Space | O(n) | O(k) |
| Streaming | No (need all items) | Yes (process items as they arrive) |

**Benchmark results** (from beads_viewer): ~15x faster for k=10 on n=10,000 items

### 36.5 LRU Cache with Disk Persistence

**Source**: CASS mining of beads_viewer cache.go and codex LRU discussions

#### Go Implementation

### 36.9 Cache-Efficient Data Layout (Struct of Arrays)

**Source**: CASS mining of cass vector index memory layout

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 40 lines. structs: VectorIndex, VectorRow; enums: VectorStorage.]

**Benefits of SoA Layout**:
| Aspect | Array of Structs (AoS) | Struct of Arrays (SoA) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Cache utilization** | Poor (loads unused fields) | Excellent (loads only needed data) |
| **SIMD friendliness** | Poor (scattered data) | Excellent (contiguous data) |
| **Memory bandwidth** | Wasteful | Efficient |
| **Prefetching** | Unpredictable | Sequential access patterns |

### 36.10 Hash-Based Content Deduplication

**Source**: CASS mining of xf and cass embedding deduplication

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 36 lines.]

### 36.11 Cache Invalidation Strategies

| Strategy | Use Case | Implementation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **TTL-based** | Time-sensitive data | Check `time.Since(computedAt) > ttl` |
| **Hash-based** | Content-derived values | Compare `storedHash != currentHash` |
| **Event-driven** | Reactive systems | Publish invalidation on data change |
| **LRU eviction** | Memory-bounded caches | Remove least-recently-used entries |
| **Version-based** | Schema migrations | Store version, invalidate on mismatch |
| **Manual** | User-triggered | Explicit `cache.Invalidate(key)` |

### 36.12 Application to meta_skill

| Component | Caching Strategy | Pattern |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Skill index** | Lazy initialization | `OnceLock` / `sync.Once` for singleton |
| **Rendered templates** | Content hash deduplication | Hash template + variables |
| **Search results** | LRU with TTL | Top-10 recent queries |
| **Parsed YAML** | TriageContext pattern | Lazy accessor on skill struct |
| **Vector embeddings** | Disk cache with hash | Avoid re-computing unchanged skills |
| **API responses** | In-memory TTL | 5-minute cache for list endpoints |

### 36.13 Caching Checklist

Before implementing caching:
- [ ] Identify the computation bottleneck (profile first)
- [ ] Determine cache key granularity (too broad = cache misses, too narrow = explosion)
- [ ] Choose appropriate TTL for data freshness requirements
- [ ] Implement invalidation strategy (stale data is worse than no caching)
- [ ] Set memory bounds (LRU eviction or max entries)
- [ ] Add hash-based staleness detection for derived values
- [ ] Consider thread safety requirements (single-threaded vs concurrent)
- [ ] Use lazy initialization for expensive one-time setup
- [ ] For hot paths, consider SIMD and cache-line alignment
- [ ] For large datasets, consider parallel processing with thread-local heaps
- [ ] Test cache behavior under memory pressure
- [ ] Add metrics for cache hit rate monitoring

**Source**: CASS mining of brenner_bot, coding_agent_session_search, coding_agent_account_manager, mcp_agent_mail, fix_my_documents_backend, and agentic_coding_flywheel_setup debugging sessions

### 37.1 Debugging Philosophy

#### The Systematic Approach

Effective debugging follows a methodical process rather than random experimentation:

| Phase | Action | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **1. Reproduce** | Create minimal, reliable reproduction | Consistent failure on demand |
| **2. Isolate** | Narrow scope to smallest unit | Single function or data path |
| **3. Hypothesize** | Form testable theory | "If X, then Y should happen" |
| **4. Verify** | Test hypothesis with evidence | Log output, debugger, or test |
| **5. Fix** | Apply minimal change | Targeted correction |
| **6. Validate** | Confirm fix works | Tests pass, behavior correct |
| **7. Prevent** | Add regression test | Future protection |

#### Debugging Anti-Patterns

### 37.2 Systematic Code Review for Bug Classes

**Source**: CASS mining of coding_agent_account_manager sync package review

#### Race Condition Hunting

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=go, 16 lines.]

**Race Condition Detection Checklist:**
- [ ] Map access from multiple goroutines → needs mutex
- [ ] Pointer/slice assignment without sync → data race
- [ ] Check-then-act without lock → TOCTOU vulnerability
- [ ] Shared mutable state in struct → needs sync primitives

#### Go Race Detector Usage

### 37.3 Error Handling Issue Detection

**Source**: CASS mining of coding_agent_account_manager ssh.go review

#### Error Handling Bug Patterns

| Pattern | Issue | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Swallowed error** | `if err != nil { /* ignore */ }` | Log or propagate |
| **Missing defer Close** | Resource opened but not closed on error | Add `defer f.Close()` after open |
| **Half-handled error** | Error checked but not all paths covered | Complete error path coverage |
| **Silent fallback** | Error replaced with default without logging | Log original error before fallback |

#### Profiling Hot Paths

**Step 1: Identify the hot path**
[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 11 lines. commands: go, go, go, go, go, go.]

**Step 2: Measure allocation pressure**

| Allocation Source | Count/Frame | Impact |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| `Renderer.NewStyle()` | 16 per item | High - 800 allocs at 50 items |
| `fmt.Sprintf()` | 6 per item | Medium - string allocations |
| `append()` to slice | 8-12 per item | Low with pre-allocation |

**Step 3: Apply targeted fixes**

### 37.12 Application to meta_skill

| Debugging Area | Pattern | meta_skill Application |
|----------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Race conditions** | Run with `-race` flag | Test skill loading concurrency |
| **N+1 queries** | Batch lookups | Load related skills together |
| **Performance** | Profile hot paths | Optimize skill rendering |

### 37.13 Debugging Workflow Checklist

Before diving into debugging:
- [ ] Can you reproduce the bug reliably?
- [ ] Do you have a minimal reproduction case?
- [ ] Have you checked error logs?
- [ ] Have you checked recent code changes (git bisect)?

During investigation:
- [ ] Have you isolated the failing component?
- [ ] Have you formed a testable hypothesis?
- [ ] Have you verified hypothesis with evidence?
- [ ] Have you checked related code for same issue?

After fixing:
- [ ] Does the fix address root cause (not just symptom)?
- [ ] Have you added a regression test?
- [ ] Have you removed debug code?
- [ ] Have you documented the fix in commit message?

## Section 38: Refactoring Patterns and Methodology

*Source: CASS mining of local coding agent sessions - refactoring workflows, clippy-driven improvements, code modernization*

### 38.1 Introduction

Refactoring is the disciplined technique of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. This section synthesizes patterns from real-world refactoring sessions across Rust, Go, Python, and TypeScript projects.

**Key Principle**: Refactoring should be incremental, testable, and driven by concrete signals (linter warnings, performance data, maintainability concerns) rather than aesthetic preferences.

### 38.2 Linter-Driven Refactoring (Clippy Workflow)

One of the most effective refactoring triggers is linter feedback. The clippy workflow demonstrates systematic improvement:

#### 38.2.1 The Clippy Fix Cycle

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 9 lines. commands: cargo, cargo, cargo.]

#### 38.2.2 Common Clippy Fixes

| Lint | Issue | Fix Pattern |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `format_push_string` | `push_str(&format!(...))` | Use `write!(buf, ...)` instead |
| `manual_let_else` | Match that can be `let else` | Convert to `let Some(x) = expr else { return }` |
| `needless_pass_by_value` | Owned type passed but not consumed | Take `&T` instead of `T` |
| `cast_possible_truncation` | `u128` to `u64` without check | Add explicit truncation handling |
| `single_match` | Match with one arm + wildcard | Convert to `if let` |
| `map_unwrap_or` | `.map(...).unwrap_or(...)` | Use `.map_or(default, \|x\| ...)` |
| `too_many_lines` | Function exceeds line limit | Extract helper functions |

#### 38.2.3 Example: Fresh Eyes Review

From a real session (destructive_command_guard):

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 26 lines.]

### 38.3 Dead Code Removal

#### 38.3.1 Detection Strategies

1. **Compiler warnings**: `#[warn(dead_code)]` in Rust, unused import warnings
2. **IDE analysis**: Gray/faded code indicating unused symbols
3. **Search verification**: `rg "symbol_name"` to confirm no usages
4. **Comment archaeology**: Check if code is referenced only in comments

#### 38.3.2 Safe Removal Process

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=bash, 9 lines. commands: rg, rg, cargo.]

#### 38.3.3 Example: Orphaned File Detection

From a real session (brenner_bot):

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 4 lines.]

**Key Pattern**: Always flag orphaned files explicitly rather than silently removing them.

### 38.4 Unused Variable Handling

#### 38.4.1 The Underscore Convention

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 8 lines.]

#### 38.4.2 Rust-Specific Patterns

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 9 lines. traits: fn.]

### 38.5 Function Extraction

#### 38.5.1 When to Extract

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Function exceeds ~50 lines | Extract logical subsections |
| Repeated code blocks | Extract shared helper |
| Deep nesting (>3 levels) | Extract inner logic |
| Comments explaining "what" | Code should be self-documenting via function name |
| Multiple responsibilities | One function = one purpose |

#### 38.5.2 Extraction Process

1. **Identify boundaries**: Find natural cut points (after setup, before cleanup, between phases)
2. **Name the concept**: The function name should explain "what", not "how"
3. **Extract with parameters**: Pass only what's needed, return only what's used
4. **Test both caller and extracted function**

#### 38.5.3 Example: Too Many Lines Fix

From clippy warning in dcg:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 18 lines.]

### 38.6 Code Organization Patterns

#### 38.6.1 Module Structure (Rust Example)

From beads_viewer architecture:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 12 lines.]

**Key Principles**:
1. **Clear separation of concerns**: loader, analysis, UI, export are independent
2. **Flat-ish structure**: Avoid deep nesting of modules
3. **Test files colocated**: `foo_test.go` next to `foo.go`
4. **Shared types in `model/`**: Prevents circular dependencies

#### 38.6.2 Layered Architecture

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=text, 9 lines.]

### 38.7 Consistency Improvements

#### 38.7.1 Pattern Normalization

From mcp_agent_mail code review:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=python, 7 lines.]

**Impact**: Cache key consistency improved (4 different path formats → 1 cache entry)

#### 38.7.2 Error Handling Consistency

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=go, 14 lines.]

### 38.8 Defensive Refactoring

#### 38.8.1 Redundant But Safe Checks

From code review:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=python, 8 lines.]

**Principle**: Accept minor redundancy when it protects against future regressions.

#### 38.8.2 Array Mutation Prevention

From brenner_bot bug fix:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 6 lines.]

### 38.9 Type System Improvements

#### 38.9.1 Strengthening Types

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 6 lines.]

#### 38.9.2 Narrowing Generic Constraints

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=rust, 5 lines.]

### 38.10 Refactoring Triggers

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Clippy/linter warnings | Fix systematically (see 38.2) |
| Failing tests after change | Understand coupling, extract shared logic |
| Performance bottleneck | Profile first, then optimize hot path |
| New feature difficult to add | Refactor to make feature easy, then add |
| Bug in complex function | Simplify first, then fix |
| Code review feedback | Address systematically |
| Upgrade to new language edition | Run migration tools, then fix manually |

### 38.11 Refactoring Anti-Patterns

#### 38.11.1 Big Bang Refactoring

**Problem**: Attempting massive restructuring in one commit  
**Solution**: Incremental changes, each tested and committed

#### 38.11.2 Refactoring Without Tests

**Problem**: Changing code without test coverage  
**Solution**: Write characterization tests first, then refactor

#### 38.11.3 Premature Abstraction

**Problem**: Creating abstractions for single use cases  
**Solution**: Wait for repetition (Rule of Three)

#### 38.11.4 Aesthetic-Only Changes

**Problem**: Reformatting working code for "cleanliness"  
**Solution**: Only refactor when there's a concrete benefit (performance, maintainability, bug fix)

### 38.12 Application to meta_skill

| Refactoring Area | Pattern | meta_skill Application |
|------------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Linter compliance** | Clippy workflow | Run `cargo clippy` in CI, fix before merge |
| **Dead code** | Detection + removal | Flag unused skills, orphaned templates |
| **Function extraction** | Too-many-lines fix | Keep skill handlers focused |
| **Module structure** | Clear separation | skills/, templates/, search/, cli/ |
| **Type safety** | Enum over strings | SkillType, TemplateKind as enums |
| **Consistency** | Normalize paths | Consistent skill path resolution |

### 38.13 Refactoring Workflow Checklist

Before refactoring:
- [ ] Do you have test coverage for the code being changed?
- [ ] Is there a concrete trigger (lint, perf, bug, feature)?
- [ ] Have you identified the smallest useful change?

During refactoring:
- [ ] Are you making one logical change per commit?
- [ ] Are tests passing after each change?
- [ ] Are you avoiding behavior changes (pure restructuring)?

After refactoring:
- [ ] Does the code pass all linters?
- [ ] Are there any new warnings?
- [ ] Is the code more readable/maintainable?
- [ ] Have you updated documentation if needed?

### 38.14 Tool Reference

| Task | Tool | Command |
|------|------|---------|
| Rust linting | clippy | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| Rust auto-fix | clippy | `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` |
| Go linting | golangci-lint | `golangci-lint run` |
| Python linting | ruff | `ruff check .` |

## Section 39: REST API Design Patterns

*CASS Research: Mined from flywheel_gateway, flywheel_private, jeffreysprompts_premium projects*

### 39.1 Overview

REST API design in agentic systems requires careful attention to schema validation, error taxonomies, authentication flows, and pagination. This section captures patterns observed across production implementations where AI agents both consume and expose APIs.

**Key Themes from CASS Mining:**
- Zod-based runtime validation with OpenAPI generation
- Structured error taxonomies with AI-friendly hints
- OAuth 2.0 Device Code flow for headless agents
- Cursor-based pagination for streaming results
- Idempotency middleware for safe retries
- Semantic HTTP status codes

### 39.2 Schema Validation Architecture

#### 39.2.1 Zod as the Single Source of Truth

A production gateway with 25+ route files and 133+ schemas demonstrates the pattern:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 34 lines.]

#### 39.2.2 Schema Categories

| Category | Count | Purpose | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Request Validation** | 46 | Validate POST/PUT bodies | CreateJobSchema, SendMessageSchema |
| **Query/Filter** | 19 | Validate GET query params | ListReposQuerySchema, SearchQuerySchema |
| **Discriminated Union** | 3 | Type-safe polymorphism | StepConfigSchema, BudgetStrategySchema |
| **Enum** | 6 | Constrained string sets | ProviderSchema, ProfileStatusSchema |
| **Configuration** | 8 | Complex nested configs | UpdateConfigSchema, RateCardSchema |

#### 39.2.3 OpenAPI Generation

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 32 lines.]

**Exposed Endpoints:**
- `GET /openapi.json` - Raw OpenAPI 3.1 specification
- `GET /docs` - Swagger UI interactive documentation
- `GET /redoc` - ReDoc documentation

### 39.3 Error Taxonomy

#### 39.3.1 Structured Error Codes

A production error taxonomy with 55+ codes across 7 categories:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 117 lines.]

#### 39.3.2 Error Response Format

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 30 lines.]

#### 39.3.3 HTTP Status Code Semantics

| Status | When to Use | Example Scenario |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **200 OK** | Successful GET, successful update returning data | Fetch reservation details |
| **201 Created** | Resource created, return with Location header | Create new reservation |
| **202 Accepted** | Async operation started, will complete later | Start long-running job |
| **204 No Content** | Successful DELETE, update with no body needed | Delete reservation |
| **400 Bad Request** | Malformed JSON, validation failure | Invalid schema |
| **401 Unauthorized** | Missing or invalid token | Expired JWT |
| **403 Forbidden** | Valid token but insufficient permissions | Wrong scope |
| **404 Not Found** | Resource doesn't exist | Unknown reservation ID |
| **409 Conflict** | State conflict, duplicate key | File already reserved |
| **410 Gone** | Resource permanently deleted | Purged job history |
| **422 Unprocessable** | Valid JSON but business rule violation | Invalid state transition |
| **429 Too Many Requests** | Rate limited, include Retry-After | Burst limit exceeded |
| **500 Internal Error** | Unexpected server error | Unhandled exception |
| **502 Bad Gateway** | Upstream service error | LLM API failure |
| **503 Unavailable** | Service temporarily unavailable | Database maintenance |

### 39.4 Authentication Patterns

#### 39.4.1 OAuth 2.0 Device Code Flow (RFC 8628)

For headless agents without browser access:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 34 lines.]

#### 39.4.2 Token Management

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 35 lines.]

#### 39.4.3 Security Analysis

| Component | Implementation | Security Property |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Device code | 32-byte random (256-bit) | Unguessable, safe for polling |
| User code | 8-char from 20-char alphabet | 25.8 bits entropy, human-friendly |
| Access token | JWT, 15-min expiry | Short exposure window |
| Refresh token | Opaque, single-use, rotation | Replay detection, family revocation |
| PKCE | Required for public clients | Prevents authorization code interception |

### 39.5 Pagination Patterns

#### 39.5.1 Cursor-Based Pagination

Preferred over offset-based for stability with concurrent modifications:

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 47 lines.]

#### 39.5.2 Cursor Encoding

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 13 lines.]

#### 39.5.3 Pagination Comparison

| Aspect | Offset-Based | Cursor-Based |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Stability** | Items shift with inserts/deletes | Stable position |
| **Performance** | O(offset) for large offsets | O(1) seek |
| **Random access** | Supported (page 50) | Not supported |
| **Implementation** | Simple | More complex |
| **Use when** | Static data, UI with page numbers | Dynamic data, infinite scroll |

### 39.6 Idempotency Middleware

#### 39.6.1 Purpose

Ensures safe retries for non-idempotent operations (POST, DELETE with side effects):

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 18 lines.]

### 39.9 API Versioning Strategies

#### 39.9.1 URL Path Versioning

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 6 lines.]

#### 39.9.2 Header-Based Versioning

[CODE BLOCK SUMMARY: lang=typescript, 17 lines.]

#### 39.9.3 Versioning Decision Matrix

| Strategy | Pros | Cons | Use When |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **URL Path** | Clear, cacheable, visible in logs | URL changes between versions | Breaking changes, public APIs |

### 39.11 Application to meta_skill

| Pattern | meta_skill Application |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Zod Schemas** | Validate skill invocation parameters, template variables |
| **OpenAPI Generation** | Auto-generate API docs for HTTP-based skill registry |
| **Error Taxonomy** | Structured errors for skill execution failures |
| **Cursor Pagination** | List skills, search results, template listings |
| **Idempotency** | Safe skill installation/uninstallation |
| **Auth** | Skill marketplace authentication, API keys |
| **Versioning** | Skill version constraints, API evolution |

### 39.12 REST API Checklist

Before deploying an API endpoint:

**Schema & Validation:**
- [ ] Request body validated with Zod schema
- [ ] Query parameters validated with coercion
- [ ] Schema registered in OpenAPI registry
- [ ] Response schema documented

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Uses error codes from taxonomy
- [ ] Includes aiHint for AI consumers
- [ ] Validation errors include field details
- [ ] Request ID included in error response

**HTTP Semantics:**
- [ ] Correct status code (201 for create, 204 for delete)
- [ ] Location header for created resources
- [ ] Proper Content-Type headers

**Pagination & Performance:**
- [ ] List endpoints use cursor-based pagination
- [ ] Reasonable default and max limits
- [ ] hasMore indicator in response

**Security:**
- [ ] Auth middleware applied
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Idempotency key support for mutations
